# Philosophers

## Overview

The **Philosophers** project explores the famous **Dining Philosophers Problem**, a classic problem in concurrent programming. The goal is to implement a simulation where philosophers alternate between thinking, eating, and sleeping, while avoiding deadlocks and resource contention.

## Features

- **Concurrency**: Implements a multi-threaded or multi-process simulation.
- **Synchronization**: Manages shared resources (forks) to prevent race conditions and deadlocks.
- **Philosophical rules**: Philosophers must:
  - Only eat when they have access to both forks.
  - Sleep and think when not eating.
  - Avoid starving while following the rules.

### Example

The simulation visualizes philosophers sitting at a round table, where each philosopher alternates between actions while sharing resources with neighbors.

## Key Concepts

- **Threads and Processes**: Use threading or process creation (`pthread`, `fork`) for concurrency.
- **Synchronization Mechanisms**: Implement mutexes, semaphores, or other techniques to manage resource sharing.
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Ensure that the simulation runs without halting due to resource contention.
- **Timing**: Precisely measure and enforce delays for realistic behavior.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing **Philosophers**, you will:
- Develop an understanding of concurrency and parallelism in programming.
- Learn to use synchronization primitives to manage shared resources safely.
- Tackle challenges like deadlock, starvation, and race conditions.
- Gain insights into problem-solving in multi-threaded or multi-process environments.
